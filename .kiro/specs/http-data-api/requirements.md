# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing sensor daemon HTTP server with data query endpoints to enable Python client access to stored sensor data without requiring direct RocksDB dependencies. The HTTP API will provide endpoints for retrieving recent readings, time range queries, aggregated data, and database information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want HTTP endpoints to query recent sensor readings, so that I can access the latest data without direct database access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request recent readings THEN the system SHALL return the last N sensor readings in JSON format
2. WHEN I specify a count parameter THEN the system SHALL limit results to that number (default 100)
3. WHEN the count parameter is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN no readings are available THEN the system SHALL return an empty readings array
5. WHEN readings contain missing values THEN the system SHALL represent them as null in JSON

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want HTTP endpoints to query sensor data by time range, so that I can retrieve historical data for specific periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide start and end timestamps THEN the system SHALL return all readings within that time range
2. WHEN timestamps are in ISO 8601 format THEN the system SHALL parse them correctly
3. WHEN the time range is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN the time range is too large THEN the system SHALL limit results to prevent memory exhaustion
5. WHEN no readings exist in the range THEN the system SHALL return an empty readings array

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a monitoring system, I want HTTP endpoints to retrieve aggregated sensor data, so that I can display statistical summaries over time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request aggregated data THEN the system SHALL compute mean, min, max, and count for each sensor value
2. WHEN I specify an interval THEN the system SHALL group data by that time interval (1H, 30T, 1D)
3. WHEN aggregating data with missing values THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately in calculations
4. WHEN the aggregation period is invalid THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
5. WHEN no data exists for aggregation THEN the system SHALL return an empty aggregates array

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want HTTP endpoints to retrieve database information, so that I can monitor storage status and data availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request database info THEN the system SHALL return total record count, database size, and time range
2. WHEN the database is healthy THEN the system SHALL include database path and implementation details
3. WHEN the database is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL indicate the status in the response
4. WHEN database statistics are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper HTTP error handling and status codes, so that I can handle different error conditions appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is successful THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with valid JSON
2. WHEN request parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with error details
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 503 with error message
4. WHEN an internal error occurs THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 with error information
5. WHEN rate limiting is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 with retry information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the HTTP API to include security measures, so that data access is controlled and safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters
2. WHEN query results are large THEN the system SHALL implement result size limits
3. WHEN expensive queries are made THEN the system SHALL implement query timeouts
4. WHEN the server is configured THEN it SHALL bind to localhost by default for security
5. WHEN multiple requests occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want the HTTP API to be efficient, so that queries respond quickly without impacting daemon operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying recent data THEN the system SHALL respond in under 100ms for typical requests
2. WHEN performing range queries THEN the system SHALL use efficient database iterators
3. WHEN caching is beneficial THEN the system SHALL cache frequently requested data
4. WHEN the daemon is collecting data THEN HTTP queries SHALL not interfere with data collection
5. WHEN memory usage increases THEN the system SHALL manage memory efficiently during queries
