# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a lightweight Linux daemon written in modern C++ that continuously reads sensor data from an SCD40 sensor over I2C and stores it in an efficient time-series format on the file system. The daemon is designed to be resource-efficient and optimized for common query patterns such as retrieving recent data points or computing historical averages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a daemon that runs continuously in the background, so that sensor data is collected automatically without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daemon is started THEN the system SHALL run the process as a background daemon
2. WHEN the system boots THEN the daemon SHALL automatically start if configured to do so
3. WHEN the daemon encounters a recoverable error THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue operation
4. WHEN the daemon encounters an unrecoverable error THEN the system SHALL log the error and exit gracefully
5. WHEN the daemon exits unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to restart the daemon
6. IF the daemon receives a SIGTERM signal THEN the system SHALL perform cleanup and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the daemon to read SCD40 sensor data over I2C with configurable sensor parameters, so that measurements are captured accurately and the system can adapt to different sensor configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daemon initializes THEN the system SHALL establish I2C communication with the SCD40 sensor
2. WHEN reading sensor data THEN the system SHALL retrieve CO2 (ppm), temperature (Â°C), and relative humidity (%) values
3. WHEN the I2C communication fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to a maximum number of attempts
4. WHEN sensor data is invalid or out of range THEN the system SHALL log the error and record the value as missing
5. WHEN individual sensor readings fail THEN the system SHALL continue collecting other available sensor values
6. WHEN sensor configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support different I2C addresses and sampling parameters through configuration
7. IF the sensor becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue attempting to reconnect periodically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want sensor data stored in an efficient time-series format with support for missing values, so that I can quickly retrieve recent measurements and historical summaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensor data is collected THEN the system SHALL store timestamp, CO2, temperature, and humidity values
2. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use a time-series optimized storage format for efficient queries
3. WHEN sensor values are missing THEN the system SHALL store appropriate null/missing value indicators
4. WHEN querying recent data THEN the system SHALL return the last N data points in under 10ms
5. WHEN querying historical averages THEN the system SHALL compute averages for specified time periods efficiently, handling missing values appropriately
6. WHEN querying data with missing values THEN the system SHALL provide options to include, exclude, or interpolate missing data points
7. IF storage space becomes limited THEN the system SHALL implement data retention policies to manage disk usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the daemon to use minimal system resources, so that it doesn't impact other system processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running continuously THEN the daemon SHALL use less than 10MB of RAM
2. WHEN idle between readings THEN the daemon SHALL use minimal CPU resources
3. WHEN writing data THEN the system SHALL batch writes to minimize I/O operations
4. WHEN the system is under load THEN the daemon SHALL maintain low priority to avoid impacting critical processes
5. IF memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement memory management strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable sampling intervals and data retention, so that the system can be tuned for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daemon starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from a config file
2. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL support sampling intervals from 1 second to 1 hour
3. WHEN configured THEN the system SHALL support data retention periods from 1 day to 1 year
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload settings without requiring a restart
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL use default values and log warnings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate messages with timestamps and severity levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for troubleshooting
3. WHEN the daemon starts THEN the system SHALL log startup information and configuration details
4. WHEN data collection statistics change THEN the system SHALL periodically log performance metrics
5. IF log files grow too large THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation to manage disk space

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a query interface to access stored data, so that applications can retrieve sensor measurements programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to retrieve the last N measurements
2. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL support time range queries with start and end timestamps
3. WHEN computing averages THEN the system SHALL support aggregation queries for hourly, daily, and custom time periods
4. WHEN multiple queries occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent read access efficiently
5. IF query parameters are invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the daemon distributed as a Debian package, so that I can easily install and manage it on Raspberry Pi and other Debian-based systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL provide a .deb package for standard Debian package management
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL automatically create necessary directories and configuration files
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL register the daemon as a systemd service
4. WHEN the package is removed THEN the system SHALL cleanly uninstall all components and optionally preserve data
5. WHEN the package is upgraded THEN the system SHALL preserve existing configuration and data files
6. IF dependencies are missing THEN the package SHALL declare appropriate dependencies for automatic installation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want a Python interface to query the time-series data, so that I can easily analyze sensor data using Python tools and libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Python THEN the system SHALL provide a Python module for querying stored sensor data
2. WHEN querying from Python THEN the interface SHALL support retrieving the last N measurements as pandas DataFrame or similar structure
3. WHEN querying historical data from Python THEN the interface SHALL support time range queries with datetime objects
4. WHEN computing aggregations from Python THEN the interface SHALL support built-in functions for averages, min/max, and statistical summaries
5. WHEN the Python module is installed THEN it SHALL be available via pip install or included in the Debian package
6. IF the daemon is not running THEN the Python interface SHALL provide clear error messages about connectivity
