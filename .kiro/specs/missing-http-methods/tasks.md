# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement missing JsonResponseBuilder methods














  - Add get_current_timestamp method to return current time in ISO 8601 format
  - Add create_http_header method to generate HTTP response headers with status codes
  - Ensure methods integrate with existing JsonResponseBuilder functionality
  - Write unit tests for the new methods
  - When done, commit to git with a brief but descriptive commit message
  - As you work on this, you cannot run cmake and/or gcc/g++ directly, since they have to run remotely. After changes have been committed to git, I can provide the output of any commands.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement missing HttpParameterParser methods





  - Add extract_method_and_path method to parse HTTP request line
  - Extract HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and URL path from request string
  - Handle malformed requests gracefully with empty string returns
  - Write unit tests for various HTTP request formats
  - When done, commit to git with a brief but descriptive commit message
  - As you work on this, you cannot run cmake and/or gcc/g++ directly, since they have to run remotely. After changes have been committed to git, I can provide the output of any commands.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 3. Implement missing SecurityManager methods





  - Add validate_request method that combines input validation and rate limiting
  - Add start_request_monitoring method to begin performance tracking
  - Add end_request_monitoring method to record performance metrics
  - Ensure proper integration with existing security infrastructure
  - Write unit tests for security validation scenarios
  - When done, commit to git with a brief but descriptive commit message
  - As you work on this, you cannot run cmake and/or gcc/g++ directly, since they have to run remotely. After changes have been committed to git, I can provide the output of any commands.
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [-] 4. Implement missing HttpErrorHandler methods



  - Add create_rate_limit_error method for rate limiting responses
  - Add create_internal_error method for server error responses
  - Add create_parameter_error method for parameter validation errors
  - Add create_method_not_allowed_error method for HTTP method errors
  - Ensure consistent error response format across all methods
  - Write unit tests for error response generation
  - When done, commit to git with a brief but descriptive commit message
  - As you work on this, you cannot run cmake and/or gcc/g++ directly, since they have to run remotely. After changes have been committed to git, I can provide the output of any commands.
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement missing IntervalParser methods
  - Add get_supported_formats method to return list of supported interval formats
  - Return user-friendly format descriptions with examples
  - Ensure consistency with existing interval parsing logic
  - Write unit tests for format information retrieval
  - When done, commit to git with a brief but descriptive commit message
  - As you work on this, you cannot run cmake and/or gcc/g++ directly, since they have to run remotely. After changes have been committed to git, I can provide the output of any commands.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 6. Verify linker error resolution
  - Build the project to confirm all linker errors are resolved
  - Run existing tests to ensure no regressions were introduced
  - Test HTTP API endpoints to verify functionality works end-to-end
  - Document any remaining issues or dependencies
  - When done, commit to git with a brief but descriptive commit message
  - As you work on this, you cannot run cmake and/or gcc/g++ directly, since they have to run remotely. After changes have been committed to git, I can provide the output of any commands.
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_
