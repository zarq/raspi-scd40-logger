# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements missing HTTP API methods that are causing linker errors in the sensor daemon project. These methods are part of the HTTP data API implementation but were not fully implemented, causing build failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all declared HTTP API methods to be implemented, so that the project builds successfully without linker errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is built THEN all HTTP API methods SHALL be properly implemented
2. WHEN HTTP requests are processed THEN all referenced methods SHALL be available
3. WHEN JSON responses are created THEN all response builder methods SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN parameters are parsed THEN all parsing methods SHALL be functional
5. WHEN security validation occurs THEN all security methods SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling methods, so that HTTP errors are handled consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP errors occur THEN appropriate error responses SHALL be generated
2. WHEN rate limiting is triggered THEN proper rate limit errors SHALL be returned
3. WHEN parameters are invalid THEN parameter validation errors SHALL be shown
4. WHEN internal errors happen THEN internal error responses SHALL be created
5. WHEN methods are not allowed THEN method not allowed errors SHALL be returned

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want security manager methods implemented, so that requests are properly validated and monitored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests are received THEN security validation SHALL be performed
2. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN rate limit checks SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN request monitoring starts THEN performance tracking SHALL begin
4. WHEN request monitoring ends THEN performance data SHALL be recorded
5. WHEN security validation fails THEN appropriate errors SHALL be returned
